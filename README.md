# database
Scripts needed for the creation of the GLAMOS geodatabase.

In collaboration between the Universities of Zurich, Fribourg and the ETH Zurich, a common database and 
datawarehouse for the Glacier Monitoring of Switzerland (GLAMOS) will be established.

The repository database contains all SQL scripts needed for the creation, maintenance and usage of the PostgreSQL-based database.
Additionally the geographical functionalities of PostGIS will be used for the spatial datasets and analysis.
